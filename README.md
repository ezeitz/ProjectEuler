# ProjectEuler
Here are my solutions to some of Project Euler's problems.  There are no doubt more eloquent ways of solving these, but I'd like to keep track of my progress and approaches to problem solving here.  Perhaps I'll go back and re-solve some of these in a later date.

As all of my projects are labeled as euler#, so if you'd like to read the specific details of each problem, you can find them at https://projecteuler.net/archives
